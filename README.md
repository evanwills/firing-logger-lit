# `<firing-logger>`

This is an app to assist with tracking firings for ceramic kilns. It has been created primarily for Illawarra Potters Inc. (a community organisation that I am a part of.)

## Installation

(at the moment there's no hosting so you have to try it for yourself, locally)

```
git clone https://github.com/evanwills/firing-logger-lit.git;
```

### Running in [Deno](https://deno.com/)

(I've recently switched to [Deno](https://deno.com/) for local
development and it's so much faster that Node JS)

```
deno install
deno task dev
```

### Running in Node

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
